# Overview of the Proposed System
1. Introduction
We describe the proposed system and emphasize its main goal, which is to forecast 
economic downturns using machine learning methods. We stress the importance of these 
forecasts for a range of stakeholders, such as policymakers, analysts, and traders. We can 
enable proactive decision-making, risk mitigation, and strategic investment approaches by 
predicting economic downturns.
2. The Definition and Effects of the Economic Recession
We go into the idea of economic recession, offering a thorough explanation and outlining its 
effects on numerous economic facets. We go over how recessions affect consumer 
spending, stock markets, employment rates, and overall economic stability. This knowledge 
is essential in demonstrating the significance of precise recession predictions for successful 
planning and decision-making.
3. Economic Recession Prediction Using Machine Learning
We examine how machine learning may be used to predict economic recessions, 
highlighting its prowess at analyzing vast amounts of prior economic and financial data to 
spot trends and warning signs. The specific machine learning models used in our project, 
such as logistic regression, decision trees, k closest neighbours, and support vector 
classifiers, are also described.
4. Sources of Data and Pre-processing
We offer insights on the data sources used in our research, concentrating on the accuracy 
and applicability of the chosen datasets. We go over how to use the S&P 500 index on the 
Yahoo! Finance platform and the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) from the Federal 
Reserve Bank of St. Louis to get economic characteristics. In order to get the datasets ready 
for analysis and model training, we emphasize the significance of data preparation 
approaches.
5. Reddit Bot for Result Dissemination
We describe the creation of a Reddit bot as a means of automating the dissemination of 
prediction results. The bot, developed using the Reddit API, allows for the automated 
19
posting of updated recession predictions and related analysis on a dedicated subreddit. This 
approach ensures timely and efficient distribution of information to a broader audience, 
including users interested in economic trends and financial markets
